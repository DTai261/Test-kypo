This is a reminder about the security risks of storing and revealing passwords through messages and files.

Do not store your passwords in plain text files. If an attacker gains access to your computer, they can easily read your passwords from a plain text file.
Do not send your passwords in unencrypted messages. If an attacker intercepts your message, they can steal your passwords.
Do not use the same password for multiple accounts. If one of your accounts is compromised, the attacker can use your password to access other accounts as well.
Change your passwords regularly. This makes it more difficult for attackers to guess your passwords.
If you need to share a password with someone, use a secure method such as a password manager or a one-time password generator.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Root
