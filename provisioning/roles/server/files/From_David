Hey Jack,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you because I'm having some trouble uploading my assignment to the student management side. My computer seems to be having some problems, so I was wondering if you could help me submit it.

I've attached the assignment file to this email. The username and password is david:iloveyou.

I would really appreciate it if you could submit the assignment for me. I'm really worried about missing the deadline.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
David
